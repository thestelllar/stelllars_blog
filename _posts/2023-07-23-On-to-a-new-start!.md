It’s a beautiful feeling being back on my blog again. I liked my first post so much that I didn’t write for the next 6 months for fear of writing something not as good as my first post. This is what happens when I try to aim for perfection. Learning from it, I’m shifting my focus from perfection to continuous improvement.
<br>
Yeah, I’ve heard about quality over quantity. But here, I’ll go with quantity over quality. Because I know what will happen if I obsess over the quality of every post — I’ll stop writing. And what could be worse than that?
<br>
I’ve been thinking about what kind of posts to write. I’ve got a lot many ideas regarding it, but for now, I will stick to writing what new I’ve learned every week. Every week is a pretty ambitious aim, but then they say it — <i>Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.</i>
<br>
I’m pursuing my research in Networks and Systems. So, you can expect blogs revolving around them. I’ve decided to go into the depths of Ethernet this week. If everything goes as planned, we’ll be discussing Ethernets next! Also, I’m interacting with so many wonderful people at MSR that you can expect a special mention of them every now and then.
<br>
So, here we have it. I’ll show up weekly. The Question is — Will you?
