Apparently, not much of Ethernet was covered this week by me. Does that mean I’ve nothing to blog about? <br>
Not really. Something interesting did happen this week. <br>

We have started a new Poetry Club at MSR! And so far, 16 people have joined our team's channel. What does the future hold for this club? I honestly don’t know. But I can see, even with my myopic eyes, that four members are there to stay. <i>(Doesn’t this resonate a bit with the four founders from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?!)</i><br>

Each one of them has something interesting to offer to the club. And I’m looking forward to learning from all of them! <br>

We had a pretty poetic start to our club. From supposedly the club’s first formal meeting over Friday's Lunch to an evening watching the movie — “Dead Poets Society.” It, indeed, was a poetic start. An imperfectly perfect one. One that we’re going to yarn about in the coming years. <br>

Owing to a “calling in my life” that I immediately need to answer, I’ll have to leave the tale of the club's poetic start for the next blog. <br>

Just in case you’re wondering about this <i>“calling in my life,”</i> it’s dinner time. I’ve to go.
