Greetings from the other side of 2024! As promised, I’m back this week. I don’t have much planned for today other than sharing two of my old poems that I’d written for my college magazine — Just Another Magazine (JAM). JAM was one of the best things that had happened to me during my college life. However, I can't ascertain if my feelings were reciprocated XD. There’s some story about how and when our paths intertwined. I’ll leave it for some other day, after all it’s a weekly business that I’ve gotten myself into.
<br><br>
The first poem — The Endgame, is pretty close to my heart. It was my first attempt at poetry and one that made me realize that writing might just be my thing. I can’t take full credit for the poem. It was one of my seniors who helped me polish the initial draft. So, thanks for that!
<br><br>
The second poem — Ragnarok, was written sometime around February 2020. I recall taking long walks on my campus in search of an <i>“inspiration”</i> tree. It was fun <i>(and cold)</i>.

Hope you liked them!

P.S. And, just in case you are curious, here’s my update — <br>

1. I did my 5K run this week.<br>
2. I’ve finished reading the novel, The Inquisitor’s Tale by Adam Gidwitz. I’ve been reading for a month now. It was a decent read, though I think it got a bit stretched towards the end. I absolutely loved the illustrations that were there along the margins. I might start The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy next. Let’s see.<br>
3. To be honest, I’m quite impressed with my daily exercise routine. There’s nothing fancy about it. It mostly involves spending more hours walking or standing than sitting, a bit of stretching in the morning, and, of course, playing table tennis XD. That’s all. And, I’m fine with it. <br>
4. I did quite some amount of journaling given the amount of confusion that seems to surround me. Though not every single day, so that’s something I’ll work on. <br>
5. Regarding negative self narrations, during a conversation, one of my friends helped me realize how I’ve been using “I have to do <i>something</i>.” a lot more than “I want to do <i>something</i>.” It was then I realized how very true it was. So, I’m working on it. <br>
6. One post every week. So far, so good! <br>

That's all from my side. See you next week.
