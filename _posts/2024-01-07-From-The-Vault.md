Hi from the other side of 2024. As promised, I’m back this week. I don’t have much planned for today other than sharing two of my old poems that I’d written for my college magazine — Just Another Magazine (JAM). JAM was one of the best things that had happened to me during my college life. Though, I can’t say if my feelings were reciprocated XD. There’s some story about how and when our paths intertwined. I’ll leave it for some other day, after all it’s a weekly business that I’ve got myself into.
<br><br>
The first poem — The Endgame, is pretty close to my heart. It was my first attempt at poetry and one that made me realize that writing might just be my thing. I can’t take full credit for the poem. It was one of my seniors who helped me polish the initial draft. So, thanks for that!
<br><br>
The second poem — Ragnarok, was written sometime around February 2020. I remember how I used to take long walks in my campus in search of an <i>“inspiration”</i> tree. It was fun <i>(and cold)</i>.

Hope you liked them!

P.S. And, just in case you are curious, here’s my update —
I did my 5K run this week.
I’ve finished reading the novel, The Inquisitor’s Tale by Adam Gidwitz. I’ve been reading for a month now. It was a decent read, though I think it got a bit stretched towards the end. I absolutely loved the illustrations that were there along the margins. I might start the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy next. Let’s see.
To be honest, I’m pretty impressed with my daily exercise routine. There’s nothing fancy to it. It is mostly about more hours walking/standing than sitting, a bit of stretching in the morning. And table tennis of course xd. That’s all. And, I’m fine with it.
I did quite some amount of journaling given the amount of confusion that seems to surround me. Though not every single day, so that’s something I’ll work upon.
Regarding negative self narrations, during a conversation one of my friends helped me realize how I’ve started using “I have to do something” a lot more than “I want to do something.” It was then I realized how very true it was. So, I’m working on it.
One post every week. So far, so good!

That's all from my side.
