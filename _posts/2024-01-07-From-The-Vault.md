Hi from the other side of 2024. As promised, I’m back this week. I don’t have much planned for today other than sharing two of my old poems that I’d written for my college magazine — Just Another Magazine (JAM). JAM was one of the best things that had happened to me during my college life. Though, I can’t say if my feelings were reciprocated XD. There’s some story about how and when our paths intertwined. I’ll leave it for some other day, after all it’s a weekly business that I’ve got myself into.
<br><br>
The first poem — The Endgame, is pretty close to my heart. It was my first attempt at poetry and one that made me realize that writing might just be my thing. I can’t take full credit for the poem. It was one of my seniors who helped me polish the initial draft. So, thanks for that!
<br><br>
The second poem — Ragnarok, was written sometime around February 2020. I remember how I used to take long walks in my campus in search of an <i>“inspiration”</i> tree. It was fun <i>(and cold)</i>.
