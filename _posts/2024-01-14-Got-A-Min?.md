Got a min?
…
Cool, do you remember the promises I made to 2024?
…
The weekly run one?
…
Yeah, the 15K one.
…
I’m one step closer to it. 6K, it is!
…
<i>(chuckling)</i> with a 100-meter sprint towards the end.
…
Ahh, non-stop too.
…
But with a pace rivaled that of a tortoise finishing a marathon XD.
…
About my other promises?
…
Pretty decent. Not much has changed over the week.
…
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Book by Douglas Adams.
…
Yeah, exercising more or less regularly.
…
Journaling? Doing it in bursts.
…
Umm, pass?
…
<i>(smirk)</i> Well, What else do you think it is? A post for this week.
…
Yeah, see you next week!
