  Hi there! I am Palak. <br><br>
  I am a final-year Computer Science student from NIT Kurukshetra. I will join Microsoft as a Software Engineer in the summer of 2023. Previously I interned with Microsoft's Bing team. I was responsible for building a Scalable, Low Latency, High Throughput, Big Data ingestion pipeline for onboarding Download Answers on Bing. That's a mouthful. I agree. But it succinctly sums up my six months of work. So I'll go with it. <br><br>
  When I'm not working, I'm reading, journalling, running, and introspecting.<br>
  My all-time favorite book is "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" He really is such a character.<br>
  I am also into maintaining my (almost) weekly journal. I like the idea of filling up my diary pages which I'm quite positive won't be flipped back again.<br>
  I love going on morning runs. So far, my best is 2 Km in 15 min non-stop. It may be unquestionably slow for some or decently fast for others. It's good enough for me. Though, of course, I strive to be better.<br>
  I like introspecting too. Whether it's me implying enjoying disguising my over-thought thoughts into introspective attire or doing some honest weighty introspection is ambiguous. Basically, I like thinking about things that I think I am thinking about. <i>(A lot of thinking just for you, Introspection.)</i><br><br>
  So far, I have talked about things I do and do pretty decently, in my opinion. There is one thing I can think of right off the bat that I am not good at. And that is giving suggestions. The only suggestion I find myself giving is, "You know what? You will figure it out yourself." So unless you want me repeating the obvious, kindly consider unlisting me from your advisory council.<br><br>
  Well, this is about me on my best days. Not every day is my best day. On days like that, I try not to beat myself up for slacking a bit.<br>
  So that's about me from me. Thanks for stopping by. I hope you have a wonderful day ahead.âœ¨<br>
  <br> P.S. I will update the profile picture once I find one that's just right. Till then here's to the starry sky!
