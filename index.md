  Hi there! I am Palak.<br><br>

I am a final-year Computer Science student from NIT Kurukshetra. I will join Microsoft as a Software Engineer in the summer of 2023. Previously I interned with Microsoft's Bing team. I was responsible for building a Scalable, Low Latency, High Throughput, Big Data ingestion pipeline for onboarding Download Answers on Bing. That's a mouthful. I agree. But it succinctly sums up my six months of work. So I'll go with it.<br><br>

When I'm not working, I am usually either reading, journaling, running, or introspecting.<br>
My all-time favorite book is "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" He really is such a character.
I am also into maintaining my (almost) weekly journal. I like the idea of filling up my diary pages, knowing they won't be flipped back again. I also love going on morning runs. So far, my best is 2 Km in 15 min non-stop. It may be unquestionably slow for some or decently fast for others. It's good enough for me. Though, of course, I strive to be better. I like introspecting too. Whether I enjoy disguising my overthought thoughts with introspective attire or I am into some honest weighty introspection is a bit ambiguous even for me.<br><br>

So that's a bit about me. Thanks for stopping by. I hope you have a wonderful day ahead.âœ¨<br><br>

P.S. I will update the profile picture once I find one that's just right. Till then, here's to the starry sky!
